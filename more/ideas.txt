

A string iterator

Example:
  auto s = "t{able|ree|uck}"
  foreach(result; generator(s)) {
    // will have "table", then "tree", then "truck"
  }

Note: if '|' and '{' '}' are at the same depth, the curly braces
      are expanded first, and then the '| is evaluated so the following:
      "1|2{3|4}"
        "1"
        "23"
        "24"
